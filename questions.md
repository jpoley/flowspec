## Current Workflow (10 min)

**1. What task tracking tools does your team use?**
- [ ] GitHub Issues
- [ ] Jira
- [ ] Notion
- [ ] Linear
- [ ] Other: _______

**2. Do you use Backlog.md or similar local task files?**

- How do they move between systems?
- Who updates what?

## Pain Points (10 min)

**4. What's the most frustrating part of managing tasks across multiple systems?**
- Probe: copy-paste fatigue, status sync, field mapping, context switching

- [ ] < 30 min
- [ ] 30 min - 1 hour
- [ ] 1-2 hours
- [ ] 2-4 hours
- [ ] 4+ hours

## Feature Validation (10 min)

**8. If you could pull a remote issue (GitHub/Jira/Notion) into a local markdown file with one command, how valuable would that be?**

**9. What fields are essential to sync?**
- [ ] Title/description

## Adoption (5 min)

**11. How likely would your team adopt a bidirectional sync tool between local markdown and remote trackers?**
- Scale 1-10 (1=never, 10=definitely)

**12. What would prevent adoption?**
- Security concerns, learning curve, reliability?

**13. Would you pay for this feature?**
- [ ] No - must be free/OSS
- [ ] Maybe - depends on price
- [ ] Yes - if it saves time

## Close (3 min)
- Any other thoughts on local/remote task management?
- Can we follow up with a survey to your team?
