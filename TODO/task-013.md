# GOAL

write up a detailed review of how this jp-spec-kit (and all of its files and changes in prompts / builds / mcps / agents) all of it, will be kept current and in sync once a project already exists. 

there are 2 main ways to install it (eventually):

1 via uv installing just like spec-kit from github

2 via claude marketplace / plugins

are both exactly equally capable of staying current for each repo.
(and ignoring things that are not relevant to the other repo, like a stack not used.)

review this in detail then ultrathink and put a detailed and accurate response in
