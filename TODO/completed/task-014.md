# GOAL

need to do research and plan out if its possible to create a layer with a spec-kit container and then use it to boot up and then use the layered filesystem somehow (hopefully without a very complicated git ignore) but then check out any git project on the next level, make prds and changes with spec-kit but don't check anything related to spec-kit back into the source repo. (because it doesn't use spec kit)  
so the goal is to USE spec-kit (or jp-spec-kit) to help build and write code and test but keep it a separate layer so that it doesn't pollute the repo. 

please analyze this in detail.  objectively what are the pros & cons of this.  would it work? 
is it actually a good idea?
please write this up, the IF and then the exactly HOW it could be done.

is there a way to manage 2 repos in git at different filesystem layers and manage git across 2 projects without merging them.

write this up in task-014-summary.md
