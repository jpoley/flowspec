# GOAL 12 A
analyze how much work it would be to pick a stack when running specify init?   (and then remove things involved with other stacks)

# Goal 12 B
also 2nd ask is how much effort would it be to install spec-kit for multiple coding agents, not only one when init is done.  
(either via init or via the marketplace via claude code) will both work

do deep discovery and then ultrathink if these are feasible and how much effort, and what that exact effort and plan would be.

write them into 2 markdown files with complete analysis and what the plan steps are to implement.
