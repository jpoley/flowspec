# GOAL

goal make each agent have just the right MCP servers (only)

- serena 
- github 
- context7

are there any others that apply to all ? 
(be conservative here, as only load needed)

propose which MCP servers go with each agent - once validated configure it.

 - SAST tooling
 - DAST tooling

 ## Release Manager
