# Assessment Reports

This directory contains assessment reports generated by the `/jpspec:assess` workflow.

## Purpose

Assessment reports evaluate features for:
- **Complexity**: Technical complexity and implementation effort
- **Risk**: Technical, security, and operational risks
- **Impact**: Business value and user impact
- **Recommendation**: Go/No-go decision with rationale

## Structure

Each assessment is named `assessment-{feature-name}.md` and follows the template in `../../templates/assessment-template.md`.

## Usage

Assessments are typically the first artifact created in the spec-driven development workflow. Use the `/jpspec:assess` command to generate them:

```bash
/jpspec:assess
```

The assessment determines whether a feature should proceed to full specification and implementation.
