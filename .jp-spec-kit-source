# JP Spec Kit Source Repository Marker
#
# This file indicates that this directory is the source repository for jp-spec-kit,
# NOT a project that was initialized with `specify init`.
#
# When this file is present:
# - `specify init` will warn and skip to avoid clobbering source files
# - `specify upgrade` will warn and skip to avoid overwriting development work
# - The repository can use its own /speckit.* and /jpspec:* commands for dogfooding
#
# DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE unless you want to treat this as a regular project.
